                    <p>In today’s modern world Airplanes are nothing new to we humans, we have at some point of time in our life seen or may have experienced an airplane flying. But this idea of creating a mechanism to make humans fly had started rising into human brains many centuries ago. Many famous stories of the ancient times involve the idea flying, such as Greek legend of Icarus & Daedalus, and the famous Indian epic RAMAYANA involves a flying vehicle called “Vimana”. The study of Aerodynamics has taken a great leap and many new air planes model are continuously developing. The RC Planes were firstly introduced for research purpose, the miniature planes were first constructed as a study model of the airplanes under research to study the forces acting on the newly designed models and the design was edited to extract the desired result. The model is a real aircraft which flies and operates by the same principles as its full-scale counterpart and the only difference is size and weight.  Along with the research purpose specially designed RC planes are also used in gathering weather readings, surveillance, etc.

                    <p class="txt1">RC Planes consists of various components which can be broadly categorized in to mechanical system and Electronic System. The Mechanical system mainly contains the Fuselage, wings, Empennage and Control Surfaces. Fuselage is considered as the main part of the airplane. It is the main body section of the airplane. Basically, it is long hollow structure which holds all the parts of the airplane together. Wings are the most important part of the airplane. The wings are airfoils attached to each side of the fuselage and are the main lifting surfaces that support the airplane in flight. The whole assembly of the tail including horizontal stabilizer and  vertical stabilizer is known as empennage. Control Surfaces are mainly used to control and manoeuvre the aircraft. RC plane mainly contains three control surfaces i.e. Ailerons , Rudder and Elevator. Ailerons are the moving surfaces usually placed near the tips of the wings. The function of the aileron is simple, by moving it in upwards or downwards direction, It controls the roll motion of the plane. Horizontal stabilizer contains one movable part which helps in pitch moment known as elevator. Rudder is movable part of the vertical stabilizer and it helps to control the yaw motion of the aircraft. The electronic system consists of Motors and propellers which provide thrust to the aircraft , ESC which converts DC Power coming from the Battery to AC Power going to the motor, Battery, Reciever and Transmitter and  Servo motors which are used to actuate the motion of control surfaces, </p>

                    <p class="txt1" style="padding-top: 2%;">Considering various design parameters of RC Plane, Team Drishti has designed and then perform various analysis over the design and after satisfactory result of analysis, we have manufactured various RC planes and also conducted various successful Flight tests.We have also manufactured various indoor testing instruments like CG Balance setup, Thrust setup and 3D analyser which would give the characteristic of the manufactured aircraft which are helpful while conducting the Flight Test. We have also participated in Boeing Aeromodelling competition at IIT Bombay and successfully got qualified for Round 2.</p>

                    <p class="txt1">RC Plane has very wide range of possible applications and various design to be implemented for various specific applications. We have achieved a stable flight  and we are further planning to use flight controller specially designed for RC Plane and hence using telemetry we can get the coordinates, velocity, altitude and various other parameters. We are also planning of using GPs with which plane would travel from one location to other as per the input given and this travel would be autonomous and it would be after take-off and before landing.</p>
